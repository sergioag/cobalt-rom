This is a list of things I want to see checked/changed/done
----------------------------------------------------------

include the spec name in the ROM signature for easy grepping
be consistent with POST port 0x80 codes
remove IO and MMIO regions stuff from romcode
do memory scrubbing before boot

Make an xmodem send/receive for ROM image
examine eeprom error states for size < 1 page
maybe rename 'lowlevel' to 'system' ?
set daylight savings cmd (date/time menu?)
	date/time menu? or config menu?
help if a cmd is misused
help for a specific cmd
better help mechanism
be consistent on read_x/write_x or set_x or set_x/get_x for cmd names
cleanup boot output
assume .gz if bfd file specified is not there
	handle this properly
fail bfd and return to prompt if file specified is not there
'FIXME' or 'fixme' comments
debug option ROM cmd
POST diagnostics/PCI BIST
fix syntax for dump_pci to take 0:0 - as output by ls_pci
make malloc and friends either NEVER fail, or printf if they do
shell-like variables?
most recent GCC compatibility
PXE boot?

extended CMOS flags/info storage
	HW Noprobe - make probe routines accept this
	boot runlevel
	user-space visible 'first boot' ?
	counter of soft errors

romcode should leave interrupts off and NMI masked, ramcode handles and enables
we need exception handlers, including NMI
writeable ROMFS
make proper EBDA and shadow-region allocation routines

make stuff static where it can be
interrupts
Option ROM probing

unify wrmsr and msr_set functions
