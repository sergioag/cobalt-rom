Notes:

The size of this stage is very critical, and very delicate.  Ramcode must fit
within the allocated space.  It is delicate because it links to a few files in
x86/common.  Every file that ramcode refernces gets linked in.  Every file
that gets linked in gets scanned for other dependencies, and those files get
linked in.  It grows quickly.  It may get to the point where large files
should not be broken up any further (logically), and we may need to link and 
conditionally compile some files for ramcode, vs monitor.
