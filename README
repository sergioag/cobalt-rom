Some notes:
-------------------------

* RAMcode + ROMcode is limited to 64k (1 page): if you change this:
	fix ROM_CRFS_OFFSET in ROM.conf
	fix romcode/reset.s (copy_rom_loop assumes sizes)
	fix tools/makerom.pl
	who knows what else

* ROMcode must be changed in 4k chunks (in ROM.conf). If you add a chunk,
  you will need to modify romcode/Makefile to include the extra chunk into
  the ROMcode.

* Suggested RPM requirements to build:
  (will need to remove any conflicting RPMs first)
	egcs-1.1.2-27.i386.rpm
	cpp-1.1.2-27.i386.rpm
	binutils-2.9.5.0.22-6.i386.rpm
	nasm-0.98-1.i386.rpm

* The ROM should always be padded with 0xff bytes to the full size of the
  device.

A map of the ROM physical layout:
---------------------------------
The ROM is made up of 16 or more pages, each of which is 64k.  We map the ROM
into the memory space at 0xffff0000 (leaving a 64k window - 1 page).  The
currently mapped page can be changed by accessing the flash page register (see
eeprom.c).

The physical ROM chips has some pre-defined structure to it. Here is how
things are laid out:
	offset		size		contents
	------		----		--------
Page0:
	0x0		0x100 (256)	Signature and version strings
	0x100		0x80 (128)	Logo and banner definitions		
	0x180		0x80 (128)	reserved
	0x200		0x8		Checksum and fixup 
	0x208		0x3df8		reserved 
	0x4000		0x9000		ramcode (stage 2)
	0xd000		0x3000		romcode (stage 1)
Page1 - end of device:
	0x0		0x10000		Cobalt ROM filesystem


Basic chronology of released rom functions:

common to 2.3.x, 2.8.x roms, and 2.9.x roms:
	flags: console, debug, rom auto-prompt
	boot method: disk, net, rom
	boot device: /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, ..., /dev/md1, /dev/md2, ...
	serial number: 13 bytes
	serial number checksum
	cmos checksum

	not so useful flags right now: cleanboot, bootcount

2.3.34: only useable in raq3/4, qube3.
	2.2 rom kernel understands ext2

added in 2.8.14: only useable in xtr
	additional flags: system fault, panic on oops, delay cache
	    	          initialization 

added in 2.9.34: useable in raq4, xtr, and 550
        2.4 rom kernel (use nvram utility instead of cmos utility)
	    understands ext2 and xfs
        flags: nologo (incomplete)
	bto from ip address w/ added cmos feature version field
	separated boot kernel from root filesystem: rom/disk/net
	    kernel and disk/net filesystem
	additional boot method: boot from net kernel, boot using
	    separate boot kernel/root fs methods
	not exposed fields: fru fault timestamp, fru error code,
	    fru status timestamp, fru status

CMOS defaults after first boot:
     1) boot from net (boot from net kernel for 2.9.x kernels)
     2) the following flags set:
           console, clean boot  (2.3.x, 2.8.x, and 2.9.x)
	   debug                (2.8.x and 2.9.x)
     3) default boot device is /dev/hda for raq3/4 and /dev/md1 for
        everything else
     4) cmos serial number will be uninitialized
     5) everything else zeroed
